**Details**: The Address Validation Extension enhances your Firebase project by validating and standardizing addresses in your Firestore documents in real-time.

The extension leverages `Google Maps Geocoding API` to automatically validate and standardize addresses when new documents are created or updated in the specified Firestore collection.

### Real-time address validation

Automatically validate and standardize addresses using when new documents are added or updated.

### Firestore integration

Seamlessly integrates with your [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) collection to store validated addresses in your documents.

### Configurable collection

Specify the collection you want the extension to monitor for updates and new documents.

### Pre-requisites

Ensure you have a Firestore collection set up in your Firebase project. This collection will be monitored by the extension to validate addresses. Provide the collection ID during the extension installation.

### Additional Setup

Before installing this extension, make sure that you've `enabled` the `Google Maps Geocoding API` for your project and obtained an `API key`.

Follow the instructions provided in the [Google Maps API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) to set up your API key.
