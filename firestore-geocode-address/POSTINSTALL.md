### Using the extension

This extension adds extra information based on the frields provided.


#### Latitude/longitude generation

Add a new document with an `address` field and add the full address of the location.

The extension will automatically add the `longitude and longitude` of the address.

```js
{
  address:  '1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA',
  latitude: 37.4223878
  longitude: -122.0841877
  ext_getLatLongStatus: {
    status: "ok"
  }
}
```

#### Calculate Driving Distance

Add a new document with `origin` and `destination` adding the full addresss of a location for each.

The extension will automatically add the `longitude and longitude` of the address.

```js
{
  origin:  '1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA',
  destination: '85 10th Ave, New York, NY' 
  bestDrivingTime: 157196
  ext_getLatLongStatus: {
    status: "ok"
  }
}
```

### Monitoring
